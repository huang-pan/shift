One way our data scientists can make their job easier is by prioritizing which sellers they outreach to first. The goal of this assignment is to derive a score that represents the expected value to Shift of acquiring a specific vehicle. The expected value that we want to derive in this homework assignment is the difference between what Shift can sell the vehicle for at retail and what dealerships buy vehicles for at wholesale.\n\n### The Data\n\nThe dataset includes a random sample of seller inquiries Shift has received in the last ~5 months for a select set of models. You will find that some sellers have expected value set to $0, and that’s because they never ended up selling their vehicle through Shift, so we don’t know what we could have sold their car for at retail. The other set of sellers, those that have a non-zero value for expected margin, did sell their vehicle through Shift and the value represents the final selling price less the wholesale value of their vehicle.\n\nQ: What is the wholesale value? <br>\nA: The wholesale value is how much this vehicle would have sold for at an auction.\n\n### The Assignment\n\nWe’d like you to present to our engineering and data science team your approach to the problem, which statistical/machine learning methods you used to come up with the model, the model itself and accuracy of your predictions. A handful of slides will suffice, but in addition to the presentation, we would like to see your code and any model diagnostics that you think will be useful to share."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Python good when using dataframes API, python + jupyter notebooks most popular\n# Uses Spark 2.+ cluster\nspark # start Spark session\n\n# Already uploaded training_data.csv to DBFS using the Databricks Table UI\n# Create a Spark DataFrame from the CSV file by inferring the schema\n# training_data_DF = spark.read.csv('/FileStore/tables/3lrl8qd31476311571313/training_data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)\ntraining_data_DF = spark.read.csv('/FileStore/tables/035u47tv1477361256947/training_data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)\n\n# quote_id, year, make, model, mileage, location_zip, percent_to_market, market_avg_days_to_sell, n_similar_vehicles_listed, region_short_code, exact_list_price, wholesale_price, seller_source, expected_margin\nprint training_data_DF # inferred schema looks OK\nprint training_data_DF.count() # 3853 rows of data in original dataset, not including header\nprint training_data_DF.rdd.getNumPartitions() # small amount of data, only one partition used"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Data Glossary\n\n**Quote ID**: Unique Seller Identifier<br>\n**Location Zip**: Postal code of the seller<br>\n**Percent to Market**: Price at which Shift would try to sell the vehicle relative to comparable vehicles currently listed in the market<br>\n**Market Average Days To Sell**: # of days it takes an average dealer to sell a similar vehicle<br>\n**N Similar Vehicles**: Number of similar vehicles for sale nationally<br>\n**Region Shortcode**: Region of the seller<br>\n**Exact List Price**: Price Shift would list the vehicle for (if acquired)<br>\n**Wholesale Price**: What dealers can buy a similar vehicle for at an auction<br>\n**Seller Source**: Whether the seller contacted us through shift.com or through our iOS app<br>\n**Expected Margin**: The value of Shift selling this car for the retail price.

Let's refer to expected_margin as the sales data that has been given to us - the non-zero margin of cars that have been sold by Shift.\n\nIn addition, normally we would want to model price. However, in Shift's case, we are modeling Expected Margin = final sales price - the wholesale price. Since the wholesale price is a predetermined, fixed quantity - a constant, we will end up modeling final sales price in the form of Expected Margin.\n\n#### Keeping the end Business Goals in mind\nSo what are we exactly trying to do here? The end goal is to increase profits for the company by using all available data.\n\nHow do we do that? There are many ways.\n\nFor example, from the above, we can use statistics to figure out ways to increase the number of inquiries.\nWe can also use predictive pricing models to figure out ways to best increase the average Expected Margin and conversion rate.\n\n#### Exploratory Data Analysis\nThe point of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to analyze descriptive statistics of the data in order to prioritize which areas of the business to target. We want to maximize usage of available resources.\n\nFor example, through EDA we can increase profits by figuring out which locations Shift should focus on. Through outreach campaigns to sellers at these locations, we can increase the number of Shift inquiries. Through marketing campaigns to buyers at these locations, we can increase the conversion rate.\n\n#### Predictive Models\nThe point of Predictive Modeling is to generate a pricing model that statistically maximizes profit for the company. This statistical model has 3 uses:\n\n1. Be a better, more consistent predictor of price than arbitrarily picking a percent_to_market price. Through this pricing model, we can identify arbitrage opportunities where cars are underpriced with respect to the market. We can also identify cars that are overpriced, and avoid those cars. By focusing outreach on underpriced cars and avoiding overpriced ones, we can increase the average Expected Margin and total profit for the company.\n\n2. Predict the Expected Margin for cars that we don't have expected_margin data for. Help guide us on how to price those cars in order to maximize profit.\n\n3. From this pricing model, we can also determine if there any underlying factors/features that have a large effect on price. If so, we can use this information to help maximize profits for the company. We can target cars with these features during outreach/marketing campaigns that increase the conversion rate and number of inquiries. This information will help us maximize profits.\n\nWith any statistical model, there's a trade off between complexity and effectiveness. Some models may have the best performance, but may be too complex (optimal parameters too hard to find) to be put into production. For our purposes, let's start with the simplest model first, and then try more complex models:\n\n- The simplest model is the Percent to Market Model (PMM). This model is somewhat arbitrary. Let us determine the market rate for the car and multiple it by a percentage < 100% to arrive at a final sales price. This may not be the best way to price cars as: A. It is very labor intensive and time consuming to gather the market rate for each make/model/year/mileage out there. This process may also be very error prone. B. Results from pricing cars this way may be very random. Still, this is a simple technique and may be worth evaluating.\n\n- Quantitative models may give more consistent results. For our first quantitative model, let us try multivariate linear regression based on car feature set.\n\n- Finally, we can try more sophisticated quantitative models like Gradient Boosted Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks, etc.\n\nTo evaluate and compare each model, a common training loss function that we can use is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the Expected Margin generated from the model and the expected_margin of the car actually sold. The goal is to use the pricing model with the smallest RMSE. The smaller the RMSE, the stronger the predictive power of the model. By minimizing RMSE, we can minimize any negative Expected Margin.\n\nIn general, we should try to use the simplest model possible that gives us the desired results that we want. The simpler the model, the fewer sources of error in our calculations, and the easier it is to understand & debug our machine learning system. And we should upgrade our quantitative model only when it consistently gives us better performance.\n\n#### Empirical Testing Framework:\nOnce we have these pricing models, we need a framework to test them in real life.\n\nGiven a pricing model, let us look at metrics of how well the pricing model works in the field. The most important metrics are expected_margin, the number of inquiries, and the number of cars sold through Shift. We can use these metrics to calculate total profit, total profit lost, and the conversion rate. Another useful metric would be the number of days it takes to sell a car.\n\nFor the price testing framework, we can test different pricing models out by region or zip code. In each zip code we can try out a different pricing model to see which one performs the best empirically according to the metrics above. We can also use Cohort Analysis and break the analyses into further subsets, e.g. by Make/Model/Year/Mileage, etc. E.g. for each zip code, which make/model has the highest Expected Margin? The highest conversion rate?\n\nWe can also track the performance over time. If we look at the entire system as closed system with feedback loop, we can adjust model parameters over time to achieve optimal performance/maximum profit. Please note that this production framework must support quick iteration of models."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n- I looked at the data in Excel first to come up with plan of action for the data cleaning and exploration.<br>\n- Data exploration is necessary to get an idea of which models to apply.<br> \nYou get a sense for which features are important.
